# Introduction

This repo implements both traditional statistical interpolation methods and modern graph neural network(including train and inference) approaches to address the challenge of two-dimensional geospatial plane interpolation.

The methodologies used in this project are detailed below:

# Traditional Statistical Interpolation Methods

- [x] ADW (Angular Distance Weighting Interpolation) https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/800186.810616
- [ ] IDW (Inverse Distance Weighting Interpolation)
- [ ] Kriging

# Modern Graph Neural Network Approaches

- [ ] GAT (Graph Attention Networks)
- [ ] GCN (Graph Convolutional Networks)
- [ ] KCN (Kriging Convolutional Networks) https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/5716

# todo list

- [ ] Add some usage examples
- [ ] visualize the interpolated graph
